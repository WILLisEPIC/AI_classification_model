# AI Classification (Alzheimerâ€™s disease)
In this project, I developed a classification model using tubular dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/alzheimers-disease-dataset). Before training models, I performed data preprocessing and visualization to enhance model performance and gain insights into the dataset. After that, I trained five models, which are Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, SVC Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and K-Neighbors Classifier, and compared them based on their performance. Among these models, Random Forest Classifier model performs the best with 93% accuracy.
